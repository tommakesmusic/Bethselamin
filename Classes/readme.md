The 'ToDoItem" class is the data model for the 'ToDo" functionality added to the site as a test for another projcet. Currently, it
keeps the data for a session but does not creat any permanent storage.

It is very simple, and just has the 'ToDo' text and a boolean to say whether the task has bee completed or not.
