# Bethselamin

My first attempt at a Blazor project.

It started life as a demo blazor server project which was modified to add functionality to the Counter page.
I then added a few pages with a few api calls to Meta Weather and XKCD.com.

It was then further modified to be used as a demo website for the Bethselamin Blockchain Legder project
and had the Counter page modified to display pretend 'blockchain' generator for the demonstration project.

It has since been modified to add very a simple 'To Do' functionality as a test for another project.

All of the functionality comes from demos on MudBlazor's site, IamTimCorey on YouTube and sme of my own experimentation.

I am using this process to learn c#, Blazor and Git/Github.
